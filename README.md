# Assignment_03
## Overview
### This project involves creating a web application using Golang that downloads CVE data, unzips it, processes it, and inserts the data into a PostgreSQL database. Additionally, it utilizes Flyway, an open-source database migration tool, to manage database versioning. The database schema and table are created, and the Golang application is used to insert data into the database.

## Technologies Used
### Golang: For developing the web application that handles CVE data.
### PostgreSQL: As the database to store processed CVE data.
### Flyway: For database migration and versioning.
### Jenkins: To automate the pipeline for building Docker images.
### Docker: For containerizing the Golang application and database migration processes.
### Helm: For managing Kubernetes deployments.

## Project Structure
### Web Application:
### Downloads CVE data.
### Unzips and processes the data.
### Inserts the data into a PostgreSQL database.

## Database Migration:
### Uses Flyway to manage database migrations.
### Creates the necessary schema and tables.
### Integrates with the Golang application to insert data.

## Jenkins Pipeline:
### Automates the creation of Docker images for the Golang application and database migrations.
### These Docker images are then used to deploy the application using Helm charts.
